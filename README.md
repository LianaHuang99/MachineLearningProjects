# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains two machine learning projects that demonstrate both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning workflows using Python and scikit-learn.  
Each project is presented in a Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization steps.
